# Case Study of Drug-Protein Interaction Analysis using Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis

Sparse canonical correlation analysis is used to linear relationship between two multidimensional variables in high dimensional data. The number of variables exceeds the number of subjects (sample size) as in the case of -omics data, pharmacogenomics, chemogenomic, interactome studies and imaging genetic studies, SCCA can be used. This method applied in R programming language [1] and combained with Drug-Protein Interaction Analysis in R programming language to propose promising repurposable drugs for COVID-19 [2].
